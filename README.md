# Stardew Valley Multiplayer Server (Docker)

The reason I made this adaptation is because I saw that the code in the other repositories are becoming quite old.<br>
In particular the Debian version, at the moment was 10, which is slowly becoming deprecated.<br>
But less-efficient code was also one of the factors.<br>

Therefor this project, it tries to modernize the packages with the same functionality.

# Getting the game files.

Getting the game files is arguably the hardest part. I love this game, and I do recommend buying it for yourself.<br>
Have fun!<br>

For indication on how to package the game yourself look at this document: [Packaging Guide](./guides/packaging.md).

# Building the image:

Once you clone this repository you can build the image using the following command:<br>
Note that you need to package the game yourself, als place it with the correct name in the local root of the repo.
```sh
docker build (-f ./Dockerfile) . -t stardew-server:latest
```
If you want to integrate the building directory into the compose, you can use the following:
```yaml
services:
  stardew:
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: stardew-server
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3001:3001/tcp"
      - "24642:24642/udp"
    volumes:
      - config:/config
      - saves:/config/.config/StardewValley/Saves
volumes:
  config:
  saves:
```
This compose creates the image from the source code once you type `docker compose up -d` with the -d meaning detached (in the background).<br>
